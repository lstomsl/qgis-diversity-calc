Welcome to DiversityCalculator!
*******************************

The goal of this plugin is to facilitate estimation of biodiversity
given a set of polygons containing the areas that you want to estimate
diversity for and a set of points where each point represents a single
species observation.

The polygon layer must have at least one string field that contains a
category name.  This could be a unique identifier, in which case
diversity indices will be calculated for each polygon.  Alternatively
it could be a field used to classify the polygons into categories. For
example you may have 30 polygons that are classified into three
different elevational ranges, Low, Moderate, and High.  In this case
the observations will be pooled over all the polygons with the same
category and one set of diversity indices will be calculated for each
unique category.

The point layer must contain at least one string field holding the
species name.  It is important that the spelling is correct or they
will be considered 2 different species.  The number of observations
for each species within a single category will be used to calculate
the diversity indexes .


Diversity Indices
*****************

The choice of which diversity index to use is a loaded topic in
ecology.  The purpose of this plugin is to provide a method for
calculating the different indices.  It is up to the user to understand
the advantages and disadvantages of the different indices and
determine which is best for them.


Species Richness
================

Species Richness (R) is simply the number of unique species observed.
While Richness is an important component of biodiversity it does not
provide the full picture.  Consider 2 areas, each of which has 1000
observations of 10 different species.  Each has species richness of 10
but what if one of thse had 900 observations of a single species and 3
of the 10 species had a single observation.  This area is pretty well
dominated by a single species. Is it more or less diverse than the
second area which also had 10 species but each of the 10 species had
100 observations making them very evenly distributed.


Species Evenness
================

Species Evenness (J’) is a measure of how evenly distributed the
number of observations for each species are.  It provides a critical
second element of biodiversity that is not encapsulated in species
richness.  Most other diversity indices are attempts at providing a
single number that reflects both species richness and species
evenness, but there is a specific definition for evenness.

Where H’ is the Shannons diversity index.  Evenness is therefore the
proportion of the measured Shannons diversity, relative to the maximum
possible value for Shannon’s diversity given the species richness (the
natural logarithm of richness [ln R]).

Species evenness ranges from 0 to 1 and one only occurs when all
species have the same number of observations.


Shannon’s Diversity Index
=========================

Shannons Diversity Index (H’) has its roots deep in information
theory. It is an estimate of entropy or information content.
Nevertheless it is relatively simple to calculate and ecologists have
found it useful because it incorporates both richness and evenness.
The maximum value for Shannons diversity index occurs when all species
have the same number of observations (Evenness = 1.000).  When that
occurs, the value of H’ will be equal to the natural logarithm of
species Richness.  Increasing either richness or evenness will result
in increased H’

Shannons diversity index (H’) is calculated according to the following
formula:

where *p*_i is the proportion of the total observations for each
species.


Simpsons Diversity Index
========================

Simpsons Diversity Index (D) is very similar to Shannons Diversity
Index.  It is calculated according to the following formula:

[image]

where *p*_i is the proportion of the total observations for each
species.

Although the calculation of Simpsons is similar to Shannons, the
properties and interpretation are quite different.  Simpsons diversity
index is interpreted as the probability that two independent
observations would be the same species.  Therefore Simspsons Diversity
Index actually decreases with more biodiversity.  Because this is a
bit counterintuitive several inverse transformations have been
proposed.

The Inverse Simpsons index is equal to 1 / D . It has a maximum value
that is equal to species richness when there is an evenness of 1.

The Gini-Simpson index is equal to 1 - D . It can be interpreted as
the probabiility that any two independent observations will be
different species.


Using the plugin
****************

To use this plugin simply go to the QGIS plugin managerand install it
on your system just like any other QGIS plugin.  You will see a
toolbutton in the plugins toolbar with the following image.

[image]

After clicking this toolbutton the following dialog will appear

[image]

Choose the layer that you want to use as the polygon layer and the
field that defines the category.

Next choose the layer containing the species occurrence points and the
field that contains the name of the species observed at that point.

Click OK and you will see a table similar to the one below.

Note that you can expand each entry to see the raw data that was used
to calculate each estimate of diversity.
